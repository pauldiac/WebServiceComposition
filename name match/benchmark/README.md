projects
  ConvertWSC - java project, includes the test generator and conversion between planning files (.pddl and .strips).
  
  psolver - polynomial wsc solver
  main.cpp contains the composition solver, that uses planning files for convenience
  
2017 KES and SYNASC - published papers

wsc2005.zip the ICEBE 2005 benchmark

tests.zip a benckmark of tests with:
  icebe - the converted wsc2005 tests
  *sf* files - tests generated by WS-Ben, with scale-free option
  test_x_y_z - tests generated by the generator from ConvertWSC, where:
    x is repository size, the number of services
    y is the generated composition (desired) length
	z is the number of maximum parameters per service
	
Tests with a large value for 'y' are usually hard to solve.
