## Web Service Composition Benchmark on Name Matching Model

## Content

 * __icebe__ tests part of the ICEBE 2005, first Web Services Challenge, processed to `.pddl` and `.strips` formats to be read by planners or our algorithm; old `.wsdl` files are too large
 * __wsben__ tests generated with the `WSBen` tool.
 * __generated__ tests generated with the implemented generator, named `test_x_y_z[type].ext`, where:
   * __x__ is the repository size, the number of services
   * __y__ is the generated composition length, the desired length that is not guaranteed but will be near. Tests with a large value for __y__ are usually hard to solve.
   * __z__ is the maximum number of parameters per service
   * __[type]__ is: `facts` for the request / query file and `ops` for repository file, and nothing for output files
   * `extension` is: `.pddl` for PDDL-type planning files, which is used by our algorithm and FF Planner and `.strips` for GraphPlan planner, `.log` for log files generated by our algorithm and `.sol_poly` contains our solution.
