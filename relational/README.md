## Relational Parameter  Matching model for Automatic Web Service Composition.
## Content:

 * __RelationalWSC__ the solver
 * __benchmark.zip__ zip archive with generated tests
 * __2019 KES__ paper published at KES conference describing the model, solver and generator
 * __2019 FROM__ short paper publishet at FROM workshop, part of SYNASC conference, with the formal definition of the relational matching composition problem
 
The code for the test __generator__ is not here as it was implemented by __Liana Ţucăr__ part of her master's degree thesis. Hopefully, the benchmark archive is enough.
