## (Automated) Web Service Composition Umbrella Repository
Contains code wrote during my Ph.D. focused on solving composition challenges and generating tests.

## Directories

 * __name match__ first algorithm implemented for the `2005 Web Services Challenge` also contains one benchmark, the test generator and other tools
     
 * __hierarchical__
   -  contributions for the first semantic composition model, from the `2008 Web Services Challenge`. does not include algorithm code

 * __relational__
    the first semantic extension proposed for automated composition: adding __binary relations__ between concepts, __inference rules__ and __objects__ as elements passed through composition

 * __object oriented__
    another semantic extension inspired by `OpenAPI` and especially `schema.org` data model. Concepts have inheritable __properties__, object properties are learned through service calls

 * __online__
    in the online version of the composition problem, the service repository and a list of composition requests can be updated __dynamically__
