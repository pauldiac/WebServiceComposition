## (Automatic) Web Service Composition
Contains code, tools, tests and papers from my PhD, focused on solving web service composition challenges.

## Content

 * __name match__ first algorithm implemented for the `2005 Web Services Challenge` also contains one benchmark, the test generator and other tools
     
 * __hierarchical__ contributions for the first semantic composition model, from the `2008 Web Services Challenge`. does not include algorithm code

 * __relational__
    the first semantic extension proposed for automated composition: adding `binary relations` between concepts, `inference rules` and `objects` as elements passed through composition

 * __object oriented__
    another semantic extension inspired by `OpenAPI` and especially `schema.org` data model. Concepts have inheritable `properties`, object properties are learned through service calls

 * __online__
    in the online version of the composition problem, the service repository and a list of composition requests can be updated `dynamically`
